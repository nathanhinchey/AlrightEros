##Capstone Project for App Academy

The concept of the App Academy Capstone Project is to showcase front and back end development, without requiring the creation of a new business idea. In order to accomplish this, we clone popular websites.

I'm cloning OkCupid, because on the back end it's matching algorithm is interesting, and on the front end its overall design and UX is interesting.
